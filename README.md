# Merkle Tree Learning Project

This is a simple Python implementation of a **Merkle Tree**, designed for learning and experimentation. It demonstrates how Merkle Trees work by building a tree from a list of transactions, generating Merkle proofs, and verifying transactions against a Merkle root.

## Features
- Constructs a Merkle Tree from a list of transactions.
- Computes the **Merkle Root**.
- Generates a **Merkle Proof** for a given transaction.
- Verifies transactions using the Merkle Proof and the Merkle Root.

## Purpose
This project is intended for educational purposes, helping to understand:
- How Merkle Trees secure data integrity in blockchain systems.
- The concept of **hash-based data structures**.
- How transactions are efficiently verified using Merkle proofs.


## NB
- This implementation is **simplified** for learning purposes.
- The hashing algorithm used is **SHA-256**.
